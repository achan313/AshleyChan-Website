        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Businessness MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am 18 years old, and I am currently a freshman in University Of California, Riverside. I am a hard-working person especially when doing what I'm interested in. I have a passion for dealing with difficult tasks. I love to exercise in my free time because I believe that a healthy body is the key of being productive during work.<br><br>

          I was born in the United States, but I had lived in Finland for two years due to my father's work. I grew up in Hong Kong and studied elementary and junior high school there. I came back to the United States when I was a freshman in High School. It is a very good experience since this allows me to speak and understand three languages: English, Mandarin, and Cantonese. I can read, write, and communicate with others in these three languages. We have five people in my family. My father is currently the COO of Nokia Corporation; my mother is a housewife. I have two younger siblings. Sometimes, I need to take care of them when my parents go to meetings around the world. I have been to many magnificent banquet with my parents. I met a lot of people there. I love to talk with the leaders from different companies and learn from them. They all have great experiences to share with me. It is fun to learn from them. I would like to attend these kind of banquet on my own, but not because of my father in the future. My hobbies are cooking, travelling, and gaming. I would like to learn a different language when I have time. Currently, I am learning Thai by myself. I like to watch Thai dramas and shows to practice listening and speaking. After learning Thai, I would like to learn French and Spanish; therefore, I will be able to communicate with more people in the world.<br><br>

        My strengths are my attitudes to challenging works. I can take both success and failure in a balanced manner. I like to work with other people because different person has different creative opinions. Also, since I lived in different countries, I can adopt easily in any type of environment. However, I am a fresher and have no work experience in any company. My short term goal is to get placed in a reputed company which will give me an opportunity to enhance my skills and knowledge. On the other hand, I am one of the leaders of the English Ministry in my church. I am the outreach coordinator and threasure. My job is to reach out to the people who is new and needs help on building their faith in Jesus Christ, and keep track on the money we have. Although we do not have many people in this new ministry, we believe that we can attract more people to join us through God and the programs we organize. That is all about myself and thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself.
